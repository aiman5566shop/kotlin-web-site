## Guidelines

## How KUG is different from other communities?

Kotlin User Group or KUG is a community of people and a place to share your Kotlin programming experience. To get named KUG, the community should have some features:

* KUG provides Kotlin-related content with regular meetups as the main format of content;
* KUG hosts regular (at least once in four months) events with an open registration without any restriction for attendance;
* KUG is driven and organized by the community and does not aim to earn money with the events or get any other business benefits from the members and attendees;
* KUG follows and ensures code of conduct in order to be a welcoming place for the attendees of any background, and experience (check-out our recommended code of conduct in “Communication standards” section)

There are no limits on a format for KUG’s meetups; they can exist in whatever way works for the community, be it presentations, hands-on labs, lectures, hackathons, or informal beer-driven get-togethers.

### How to run official KUG?

We recommend hosting one group per city. Check out the list of KUGs and find out a KUG in your city

* We recommend hosting one group per city. Check out the list of KUGs and find out a KUG in your city.
* Use official KUG logo and branding. Check out the branding guidelines
* Keep your user group active. Run meetups regularly, at least once in 4 months
* Establish an online communication space for your community. It helps people to get information from their peers in their native language, and helps you as an organizer to grow your community, have an “all in one place” communication channel, a place where you can find a hand whenever you need
* Create a space for meetups management and announcements (alt: create a meetup.com group space).
* Make sure you announce the KUG’s meetups at least 2 weeks before. The announcement should contain a list of talks, names of speakers, place, timing and other crucial info about the event.
* KUG's events should be free or if you need to cover organizing expenses, hold on prices up to 10 USD
* The group should have a code of conduct available for all members
* An active KUG should have a team of at least two organizers
